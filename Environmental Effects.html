                <p>
                    Soil erosion is the detachment and transportation of soil particles by wind, water, or gravity. 
                    It's a naturally occurring process, but human activities have accelerated soil erosion to rates exceeding its natural replacement. 
                    This large-scale erosion has severe consequences for the environment on a global scale.
                    Here are some of the detailed information about global environmental effects of soil erosion:

                            <h1>Reduced Agricultural Productivity:</h1>
                            <p>Soil erosion can negatively impact agriculture by reducing crop yields and quality. Here are some ways soil erosion can affect agriculture:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><span>Loss of Nutrients and Decreased soil fertility:</span> Topsoil is the lifeblood of agriculture. It teems with organic matter, which decomposes to release essential plant nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. 
                                    These nutrients are crucial for plant growth and development. When erosion washes away topsoil, it depletes these vital elements, making the land less fertile. 
                                    Farmers might resort to using more fertilizers to compensate for the lost nutrients. However, this can lead to a vicious cycle. 
                                    Excessive fertilizer application can contribute to further soil erosion, as well as water pollution from nutrient runoff.
                                </li>
                                <hr>
                                <li><span>Degraded Soil Structure:</span> Healthy soil has a crumbly structure formed by aggregates-clumps of soil particles bound together by organic matter. 
                                    This structure allows for good water drainage and aeration. Air pockets within the aggregates provide oxygen for plant roots to breathe and for soil microbes to thrive. 
                                    These microbes play a vital role in nutrient cycling and decomposition. Erosion disrupts this delicate structure, breaking down the aggregates and leading to compacted soil. 
                                    Compacted soil has less space for air and water, hindering root growth and reducing the soil's ability to hold water. 
                                    This creates a stressful environment for plants, making them more susceptible to drought and disease.
                                </li>
                                <hr>
                                <li><span>Higher rates of runoff:</span> Soil erosion can cause more water to run off, shedding water and nutrients that would otherwise be used for crop growth.
                                </li>
                                <hr>
                                <li><span>Flooding:</span> Soil erosion can cause soil-laden water to flow downstream, creating thick layers of sediment that can prevent streams and rivers from flowing smoothly.
                                </li>
                                <hr>
                                <li><span>Increased Erosion Susceptibility:</span> Once topsoil is gone, the remaining subsoil is exposed. Subsoil is generally less fertile and has a poorer structure than topsoil. 
                                    It is also more prone to erosion because it lacks the protective cover of organic matter and vegetation that topsoil provides. This creates a domino effect, accelerating the degradation of agricultural land. 
                                    Even moderate rainfall events can cause significant erosion on exposed subsoil, further depleting the land's productivity.

                                It is estimated that up to 40% of the world's agricultural land is affected by soil erosion.

                        The map on the left shows the global soil degradation due to a range of factors.
                        Soil degradation refers to the loss of biological or economic productivity on land.
                        Different types of land degradation are affecting approximately 1.5 billion people, particularly in developing countries.
                        It can be derived that the majority of soil degradation is contributed by soil erosion.
                        Soil erosion is a major global soil degradation threat to land, freshwater, and oceans.
                        Contemporary societies live on a cultivated planet where agriculture covers ~38% of the land surface. 
                        Humans strongly depend on the capacity of soils to sustain agricultural production and livestock, which contributes more than 95% of global food production.
                        The latest United Nations (UN) report on the status of global soil resources highlights that "…the majority of the world's soil resources are in only fair, poor, or very poor condition..." and stresses that soil erosion is still a major environmental and agricultural threat worldwide.

                        A global map of countries' soil erosion performance The map is based on soil erosion discontinuities between each country and all of its neighbours (unweighted). 
                        Darker green indicates that a country has a more positive impact on the global rate of soil erosion than its neighbours (that is, it has a dampening effect), and darker red indicates that a country has a more negative impact on the global rate of soil erosion (that is, it has higher erosion rates). 
                        For all countries that perform more poorly than their neighbours, the map shows how much soil erosion they could mitigate (per hectare and year) just by catching up to their neighbours. Even the better performing countries could probably further improve their impact, so this map probably presents a lower bound for countries' erosion mitigation potential—especially in regions where soil erosion is high. 
                        For reference, the global average soil erosion rate is 2.4 t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹, and we estimate the average country discontinuity at 1.4 t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹.
